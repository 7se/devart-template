## Description


Traget User: Long-Distances' lovers
Discription: For LDR peoples, the distances is always the biggest problem. For them they communicate by words, audios and cybercams to feel the existances of the relationship. However, all those ways are only on the niveau of 'thought', they couldn't feel each others' emotions, what are as usual as the breath or the beat of heart. I hope those LDR peoples could through the interaction design, precisely, by visual technic, to really feel each other's emotions' changes, and then, draw the distance more closer. 

Tech Use:


the app use the gtalk name and passcode to login.

XMPP is used in the app for connecting the phone your Lover use.

when app start it will run a service in back to wait for the "blow message".

when the "blow message" come,no matter what is show on the screen it will draw the "halitus" on screeen like your lover 

blow on your glasses.

when start to blow,it will catch the sound from the mic,with the FFT it will caculate the freenquence of the sound,and 

judge if it is the blow or the other sound.

Visual Description:
Inputing the dates of breath (Control through changing the color or else), we transform those dates stream in a mobile phone interface, and make it become an airflow form's visual icons, and we can control it in a interaction way, which makes the interactive more interesting.  We want to collect the breathe of couples through by an app named M Here. For example,Ms.A and Mr.B are one distance couple. If they are partnership in the app. A can blow gently on the  working interface of the app on her mobile phone and she can see some moving image ï¼Œwhich created by her blowing or her breathe. Although Mr.B is far away from Ms A.'HIs phone also will appear the same moving image which created by Ms.A's blowing or breath. It's a way to express although we are not in the same city or country, I am always at your side. I'm always here.


## Example Code
NOTE: Wrap your code blocks or any code citation by using ``` like the example below.
``` 
function test() {


  console.log("Printing a test");

  for(int i=0;i<length;i++)

  {
    for(int j=0;j<width;j++)

    {
     
 bitmap[i][j]=(Math.sin(i*Math.cos(j))<<24)&0xffffff;

    }

  }

  for(int alpha=0;alpha<255;alpha++)

  {
    bitmap.setAlpha(alpha);

      bitmap.draw();
  
      sleep(30);

  }


}
