## Description


Traget User: Long-Distances' lovers
Discription: For LDR peoples, the distances is always the biggest problem. For them they communicate by words, audios and cybercams to feel the existances of the relationship. However, all those ways are only on the niveau of 'thought', they couldn't feel each others' emotions, what are as usual as the breath or the beat of heart. I hope those LDR peoples could through the interaction design, precisely, by visual technic, to really feel each other's emotions' changes, and then, draw the distance more closer. 

Tech Use:


the app use the gtalk name and passcode to login.
XMPP is used in the app for connecting the phone your Lover use.
when app start it will run a service in back to wait for the message.
when the message come,no matter what is show on the screen it will draw the "halitus" on screeen like your lover blow on your glasses.

  {
    for(int j=0;j<width;j++)

    {
     
 bitmap[i][j]=(Math.sin(i*Math.cos(j))<<24)&0xffffff;

    }

  }

  for(int alpha=0;alpha<255;alpha++)

  {
    bitmap.setAlpha(alpha);

      bitmap.draw();
